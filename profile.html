			<h2>Web Developer</h2>
			<p>Hello! I'm Drew, a Developer and Product Manager based in Ann Arbor, Michigan. I specialize in front-end development and have experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. I have worked in the digital hospitality and marketplace space for a long time, but have recently transitioned in the last 3 years to technical work. At heart, I'm a maker who wants to build computery things. I'm most committed to ethical tech and in my spare time I volunteer and lobby for humane technology. I build products that help us focus, because without focus we can't achieve our goals. </p>
